# File Processor

Testing systems that interact with 3rd party systems through file interfaces can be difficult. Whether testing the interfaces themselves or the workflow of a system, not being able to interact with 3rd party systems consistently can cause significant issues. This project was developed to setup a framework for generating files that can be used in place of the 3rd party system for use with testing.
